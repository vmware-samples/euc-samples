## Package Deployment Details

After obtaining the correct package from CrowdStrike directly, you will parse the pkg using the Admin Assistant. After that follow the below steps:
1) Edit the plist file that is created to ensure the 'Name' and 'Version' keys are in line with what you are expecting.
  * The Name key is how the app will appear in the UEM console as well as on the user's Hub Catalog.
2) Upload the pkg and plist files to UEM using the Add Application workflow (Resources > Apps > Native > Internal)
3) Add the icon under Images tab
4) Add the following scripts under the Scripts tab
  * Post Install Script - needed to activate the license, replace INSERT_LICENSE_HERE with the actual license string
  ```BASH
  #!/bin/sh
  /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl license INSERT_LICENSE_HERE
  exit 0
  ```
  * Post Uninstall Script - ensure app is removed if functionality is enabled. No maintenance token, if token is needed â€“ add it after uninstall in line
  ```BASH
  #!/bin/sh
  sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl uninstall
  exit 0
  ```
  * Install Check Script - ensure CrowdStrike is installed and proper version activated. Update the target version to what you are deploying in first line
  ```BASH
  #!/bin/sh
  target_version=6.26.13904.0

  #convert version number to individual
  function version { echo "$@" | /usr/bin/awk -F. '{ printf("%d%03d%03d%03d\n", $1,$2,$3,$4); }'; }

  # Grab current version of installed crowdstrike
  current_version=$(/usr/bin/sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl stats | /usr/bin/grep version | /usr/bin/awk '{print $2}')
  echo CrowdStrike version $current_version

  # Compare with the version we want to install
  if [ $(version $current_version) -lt $(version $target_version) ]; then
      echo install CrowdStrike
      exit 0
  else
      echo CrowdStrike is installed
      exit 1
  fi
