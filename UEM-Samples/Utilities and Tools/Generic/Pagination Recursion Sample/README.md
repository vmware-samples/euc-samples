## Detection Criteria
The sample provides one example for AppExists, if this needs to be changed then the following templates should replace file exists.

#### File Exists
Below is an example of FileExists, most of the fields can be modified to match what is set for the app being uploaded.

```json
{
    "CriteriaType": "FileExists",
    "FileCriteria": {
        "Path": "Path to File ",
        "VersionCondition": "GreaterThan",
        "MajorVersion": 16,
        "MinorVersion": 0,
        "RevisionNumber": 0,
        "BuildNumber": 0,
        "ModifiedOn": "1999-02-03"
    },
    "LogicalCondition": "End"
