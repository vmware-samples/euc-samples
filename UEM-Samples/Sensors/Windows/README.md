- **Date Created**: 11/14/2018
- **Updated**: 9/24/2021
- **Supported Platforms**: Workspace ONE 1811+
- **Tested on**: Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise 1803+


## Purpose
These Workspace ONE Sensor samples contain PowerShell command lines or scripts that can be used in a **Devices > Sensors** payload to report back information about the Windows 10 or macOS device back to Workspace ONE.

## Description 
There are Sensor samples, templates, and a script `import_sensor_samples.ps1` to populate your environment with all of the samples.    

## Required Changes/Updates
You will want to leverage the `template_`  samples and modify any of the data, or leverage the existing samples. You can also leverage the `import_sensor_samples.ps1` script to upload the samples to your environment. Only the templates and the Sensor Importer require changes. Samples work as is, but can also be modified for your needs. 

For Windows 10 Samples be sure to use the following format when creating new samples so that they are imported correctly:

    # Description
    # Return Type: String | Integer | Boolean | DateTime
    # Execution Context: System | User
	<YOUR POWERSHELL COMMANDS>

For macOS Samples be sure to use the following format when creating new samples so that they are imported correctly:
	    
	<YOUR SENSOR COMMANDS>
	# Description
    # Return Type: String | Integer | Boolean | DateTime
    # Execution Context: System | User


### WMI Query Template
    $wmi=(Get-WmiObject WMI_Class_Name)
    return $wmi.Attribute_Name

### Registry Value Template 
    $reg=Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\Key Folder\Key Name"
    return $reg.ValueName

### Hash Value Template 
    $file=Get-FileHash ([Environment]::SystemDirectory + "\filename.exe") -Algorithm MD5
	return $file.Hash

### Folder Size Template 
    $TargetFolder = [Environment]::GetFolderPath("MyPictures")
	$FolderInfo = Get-ChildItem $TargetFolder -Recurse -File | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum
	$FolderSize = ($FolderInfo.Sum/1MB)
	return  ([System.Math]::Round($FolderSize))

## Workspace ONE Sensors Importer

### Synopsis 
This Powershell script allows you to automatically import PowerShell/Shell (.sh & .zsh)/Python scripts (Sensor Samples) as Workspace ONE Sensors in the Workspace ONE UEM Console. MUST RUN AS ADMIN

### Description 
Place this PowerShell script in the same directory of all of your samples (.ps1/.sh/.zsh/.py files, note file extension is not required, sha-bang will be used to determine scripting language) or use the `-SensorsDirectory` parameter to specify your directory. This script when run will parse the sensor sample scripts, check if they already exist, then upload to Workspace ONE UEM via the REST API.

### Examples 

- **Basic**: this command shows all required fields and will scan the default directory and upload the samples to Workspace ONE via the REST API using the credentials provided. 

    	.\import_sensor_samples.ps1 `
        -WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd' `
        -WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc=' `
        -OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone' `

- **Custom Directory**: using the `-SensorsDirectory` parameter tells the script where your samples exist. The directory provided must have script files which you want uploaded as Sensors. 

    	.\import_sensor_samples.ps1 `
        -WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd' `
        -WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc=' `
        -OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone' `
		-SensorsDirectory 'C:\Users\G.P.Burdell\Downloads\Sensors'

- **Assign to Smart Group**: using the `-SmartGroupID` or `-SmartGroupName` parameter will assign ALL Sensors which were uploaded and that already exist to that chosen Smart Group. ***Existing Smart Group memberships will be overwritten!*** This command is used best in a test environment to quickly test Sensors before moving Sensors to production. Obtain the Smart Group ID via API or by hovering over the Smart Group name in the console and looking at the ID at the end of the URL. 

    	.\import_sensor_samples.ps1 `
        -WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd' `
        -WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc=' `
        -OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone' `
        -SmartGroupName 'All Devices' `

- **Assign to Smart Group and Set EVENT Triggers**: using the `-SmartGroupID` or `-SmartGroupName` parameter will assign ALL Sensors which were uploaded and that already exist to that chosen Smart Group. ***Existing Smart Group memberships will be overwritten!*** This command is used best in a test environment to quickly test Sensors before moving Sensors to production. Obtain the Smart Group ID via API or by hovering over the Smart Group name in the console and looking at the ID at the end of the URL. 

    	.\import_sensor_samples.ps1 `
        -WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd' `
        -WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc=' `
        -OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone' `
        -SmartGroupName 'All Devices' `
		-TriggerType 'EVENT' `
		-LOGIN -LOGOUT -STARTUP -USER_SWITCH

- **Delete All Sensors**: using the `-DeleteSensors` switch parameter will delete ALL Sensors which were uploaded and that already exist to that chosen Organization Group. ***All Sensors will be deleted, including the Sensors which were manually added!*** 

    	.\import_sensor_samples.ps1 `
        -WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd' `
        -WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc=' `
        -OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone' `
		-DeleteSensors

- **Update Sensors or Overwrite Existing Sensors**: using the `-UpdateSensors` switch parameter will update ALL Sensors that already exist which the version in the Sensor samples. This is best used when updates and fixes are published to the source Sensor samples.

    	.\import_sensor_samples.ps1 `
        -WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd' `
        -WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc=' `
        -OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone' `
		-UpdateSensors
