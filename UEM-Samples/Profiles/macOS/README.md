# EUC-samples

## macOS-Samples \ CustomXMLProfiles
This section of the **EUC-samples** repository contains samples relating to profile snippets which can be used in the "Custom Settings" or "Custom XML" payload in Workspace ONE UEM for macOS management.  Custom XML samples are typically used to manage key-value pairs in macOS preference domains.  For more information on Custom XML, refer to [Custom XML Preferences - VMware EUC Blog](https://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2017/06/xml-preferences.html) and the [Custom XML Template](https://github.com/vmware-samples/euc-samples/blob/master/macOS-Samples/CustomXMLProfiles/CustomXMLTemplate.md).


Please feel free to submit any scripts you wish to share with the community!

* Please use one branch per sample or change-set
* Please use one commit and pull request per sample
* Please post the sample output along with the pull request
* If you include a license with your sample, use the project license

### Code Style

We won't actively enforce any "official" style guides, but do ask that you do what you can to:
* Make your samples easily readable
* Make your samples easily reusable
* Include in-line comments to help with readability

## Resource Maintenance

### Maintenance Ownership
Maintenance of any and all submitted samples is to be performed by the community.  If you can make a sample better, please feel free to submit a pull request to improve it!

### Filing Issues
Any bugs or other issues should be filed within GitHub by way of the repositoryâ€™s Issue Tracker.

### Resolving Issues
Any community member can resolve issues within the repository, however only the board member can approve the update. Once approved, assuming the resolution involves a pull request, only a board member will be able to merge and close the request.

### VMware Sample Exchange
It is highly recommended to add any and all submitted samples to the VMware Sample Exchange:  <https://code.vmware.com/samples>

Sample Exchange can be allowed to access your GitHub resources, by way of a linking process, where they can be indexed and searched by the community. There are VMware social media accounts which will advertise resources posted to the site and there's no additional accounts needed, as the VMware Sample Exchange uses MyVMware credentials.
