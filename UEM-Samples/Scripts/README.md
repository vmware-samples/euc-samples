# Workspace ONE Scripts

## Overview
- **Authors**: Josue Negron
- **Email**: jnegron@vmware.com
- **Date Created**: 1/18/2021
- **Updated**: 1/22/2021
- **Supported Platforms**: Workspace ONE 2011+ (Tech Preview Features Dependent - use CN135/137/138)
- **Tested on**: Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise 20H2+

## Purpose
These Workspace ONE Script samples contain command lines or scripts that can be used in a **Resources > Scripts** payload to execute commands on managed Windows 10 or macOS devices and report execution status back to Workspace ONE.

## Description 
There are Script samples, templates, and a script `import_script_samples.ps1` to populate your environment with all of the samples.    

## Required Changes/Updates
You will want to leverage the `template_`  samples and modify any of the data, or leverage the existing samples. You can also leverage the `import_script_samples.ps1` script to upload the samples to your environment. Only the templates and the Script Importer require changes. Samples work as is, but can also be modified for your needs. 

For Windows 10 Samples be sure to use the following format when creating new samples so that they are imported correctly:

    # Description
	# Execution Context: System | User
	# Execution Architecture: EITHER_64BIT_OR_32BIT | ONLY_32BIT | ONLY_64BIT | LEGACY
	# Timeout: ## greater than 0
	# Variables: KEY,VALUE; KEY,VALUE
	<YOUR POWERSHELL COMMANDS>

For macOS Samples be sure to use the following format when creating new samples so that they are imported correctly:
	    
	<YOUR SCRIPT COMMANDS>
	# Description
	# Execution Context: System | User
	# Execution Architecture: UNKNOWN
	# Timeout: ## greater than 0
	# Variables: KEY,VALUE; KEY,VALUE

## Workspace ONE Scripts Importer

### Synopsis 
This Powershell script allows you to automatically import Windows 10 and macOS scripts as Workspace ONE Scripts in the Workspace ONE UEM Console. MUST RUN AS ADMIN

### Description 
Place this PowerShell script in the same directory of all of your samples (.ps1, .sh, .zsh, .py files) or use the -ScriptsDirectory parameter to specify your directory. This script when run will parse the sample scripts, check if they already exist, then upload to Workspace ONE UEM via the REST API. You can leverage the optional switch parameters to update scripts or delete all scripts.

### Examples 

- **Basic**: this command shows all required fields and will scan the default directory and upload the samples to Workspace ONE via the REST API using the credentials provided. 

    	.\import_script_samples.ps1 `
        -WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator' `
        -WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd' `
        -WorkspaceONEAPIKey '7t5NQg8bGUQdRTGtmDBXknho9Bu9W+7hnvYGzyCAP+E=' `
        -OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone'

- **Custom Directory**: using the `-ScriptsDirectory` parameter tells the script where your samples exist. The directory provided must have script files which you want uploaded as Scripts. 

    	.\import_script_samples.ps1 `
        -WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com' `

- **Assign to Smart Group**: using the `-SmartGroupID` or `-SmartGroupName` parameter will assign ALL Scripts which were uploaded and that already exist to that chosen Smart Group. ***Existing Smart Group memberships will be overwritten!*** This command is used best in a test environment to quickly test Scripts before moving Scripts to production. Obtain the Smart Group ID via API or by hovering over the Smart Group name in the console and looking at the ID at the end of the URL.
