## Purpose 
This folder has a sample configuration that will apply a custom firewall rule for an application on a Windows 10 Desktop for versions 1709 and above.
The [Firewall CSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/firewall-csp) was introduced in the 1709 update and only applies to the Windows 10 Desktop SKU.

The Sample configuration creates a Firewall rule that allows an applications traffic to come inbound through the firewall. Outbound rules can be specified as well.

## Required Changes/Updates
Please update the `<Data> </Data>` tag with the right values for your firewall rule and application. Please see the CSP link provided for additional nodes and configurations.

Change the Rule name route node to match each value node. Change `<CHANGEME - CustomFirewallRule Name>` to `RuleNameExample` at each LocURI in the sample.

## Change Log
- 11/14/2017: Created sample for Firewall Rules with app exceptions.
