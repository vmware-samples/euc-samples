## SYNOPSIS

The script will create a Tag in the specified Airwatch environment for a specified colllection or all Device collections. Each memeber of the collection is queryied in Airwatch and if the devices exists, the tag will be applied to the device.  This allows correlation between SCCM and Airwatch for co-existance.  Devices can still be grouped with SCCM collections, but managed through Airwatch for tasks such as software distribution.
