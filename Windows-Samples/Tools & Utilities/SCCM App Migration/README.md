## DESCRIPTION
When run, this script will prompt you to select an application for migration. It then parses through the deployment details of the application and pushes the application package to AirWatch. The script then maps all the deployment commands and settings over to the AirWatch application record. MSIs are ported over as-is. Script deployments are ported over as ZIP folders with the correct execution commands to unpack and apply them.
	
## Modifications Required
This script must be run as an admin

## Known Issues
One some screens the form that shows the SCCM Apps does not render correctly. You can still select an app and hit Enter.
